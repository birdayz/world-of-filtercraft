## Layout & Composition

This is a single tarot-sized card with the following layout from top to bottom:

1. **Top banner**: Small text "Epische Ereigniskarte" in elegant gold serif font
2. **Icon area**: A detailed gold emblem of a dragon sitting atop a treasure hoard, rendered in a heraldic/medallion style
3. **Title**: Large dramatic fantasy lettering reading exactly: **Der Hort des Weltenfressers** - gold text with subtle glow effect
4. **Description area**: A parchment-colored text panel with elegant serif text reading exactly: **Du hast den Hort des Weltenfressers bezwungen! 1 Million Goldmünzen füllen deine Hallen bis unter die Decke. Der Reichtum deiner Ahnen ist wiederhergestellt!**
5. **Flavor/lore text**: Below the description panel, a short italic quote in smaller gold text on the dark background, like Magic: The Gathering flavor text. Reading exactly: *"Die Münzen des Weltenfressers flüstern noch immer seine Geheimnisse."*

## Environment

- **Background**: Deep midnight blue to dark purple gradient with subtle magical particle effects and faint arcane symbols
- **Border**: Ornate gold filigree border running along all four edges. The border features intertwined Celtic/fantasy knotwork patterns, small runes, and **dragon and treasure motifs** woven into the border corners and edges. The border should be elaborate but refined - think luxury playing card. The border theme must match this card's dragon/treasure topic.
- **Overall mood**: Dark, rich, magical, prestigious. Like a rare card from a AAA fantasy card game.
