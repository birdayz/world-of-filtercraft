## Technical Specifications
- **Format**: Tarot card, portrait orientation, 9:16 aspect ratio
- **Style**: Card back design matching the World of Filtercraft visual universe

## Layout & Composition

This is the BACK side of a playing card. It must be symmetrical and contain NO game-specific information. Design from center outward:

1. **Center emblem**: A large, ornate gold medallion/seal featuring a stylized fantasy eye or compass motif surrounded by swirling filter/prism rays — the "Filtercraft" symbol. Intricate, heraldic, symmetrical.
2. **Title**: **World of Filtercraft** in elegant gold serif lettering, centered below the emblem
3. **Subtitle**: **The Diamond Quest** in smaller gold italic text beneath the title
4. **Decorative pattern**: The entire card is filled with a repeating ornate gold filigree pattern — Celtic knotwork interwoven with arcane runes and subtle fantasy motifs. The pattern is perfectly symmetrical (180-degree rotational symmetry, like a traditional card back).
5. **Border**: A thick ornate gold frame with corner flourishes matching the front card borders

## Environment

- **Background**: Deep midnight blue to dark purple gradient, rich and luxurious
- **Color palette**: Gold, midnight blue, deep purple — matching the front card universe exactly
- **No text other than the title and subtitle** — this is a card back, not a card front
- The design must look identical regardless of card orientation (rotationally symmetrical)

## Critical Requirements

- Must look like a professional TCG/tarot card back
- Perfectly symmetrical design (player should not be able to tell card orientation)
- Same visual quality and universe as the front cards
- NO game stats, NO character info, NO event info — purely decorative
- The entire image IS the card back
